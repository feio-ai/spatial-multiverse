  /** Calculate delay line costs:
    * a. Determine time (in cycles) any given input or internal signal needs to be delayed
    * b. Distinguish each delay line as a separate entity
    *
    * To determine this without fully building the tree:
    * Think of the tree as composed of perfectly balanced binary tree subgraphs
    * The size and number of these required is just the binary representation of the # of leaves
    * Then just calculate the number of delays required across different trees to combine them
    * E.g.
    *   8 inputs => perfectly balanced binary tree, no delay paths
    *   9 inputs => 1 path of length 3
    *   85 inputs => 3 paths with lengths 2, 1, and 1
